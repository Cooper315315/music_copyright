# Music Copyright Management System

## 1. Introduction

*   This Python application provides a secure system for managing music-related documents and audio files. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their music-related assets in a protected environment. The system incorporates strong security measures to protect sensitive data, including AES-256 encryption for data storage, bcrypt for password hashing, and input sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Security Features

*   **AES-256 Encryption:** All documents and audio files are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key. This ensures that the data is protected from unauthorized access, even if the database is compromised. AES is a widely recognized and robust encryption algorithm, suitable for securing sensitive information [1].  The encryption key is derived from the password you enter when adding documents or audio files. If you forget the password, you will not be able to decrypt the data.
*   **bcrypt Password Hashing:** User passwords are not stored in plain text. Instead, they are hashed using bcrypt, a strong adaptive hashing algorithm. Bcrypt incorporates a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and is computationally intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks [2].
*   **Input Sanitization:** The application implements input sanitization techniques to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). User inputs, such as filenames and usernames, are validated and sanitized to remove or escape potentially harmful characters [3].

## 3. Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Windows

1.  **Install Python:**

    *   Download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
    *   Run the installer and ensure that you select the option to add Python to your PATH environment variable.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *   Open a command prompt (search for "cmd" in the Start menu).
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved the `music_copyright-v15.py` script using the `cd` command.
    *   Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

        ```
        pip install cryptography bcrypt
        ```

### macOS

1.  **Install Python:**

    *   macOS usually comes with Python pre-installed, but it's often an older version. It's recommended to install a newer version using Homebrew.
    *   If you don't have Homebrew, install it from the official website: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
    *   Open a terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight).
    *   Run the following command to install Python 3:

        ```
        brew install python3
        ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *   Open a terminal.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved the `music_copyright-v15.py` script using the `cd` command.
    *   Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

        ```
        pip3 install cryptography bcrypt
        ```

## 4. Usage

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided Python script (`music_copyright-v15.py`) to a directory on your computer.
2.  **Run the Script:**

    *   Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS).
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the `cd` command.
    *   Run the script using the following command:

        ```
        python music_copyright-v15.py
        ```

3.  **Follow the Prompts:** The script will guide you through a menu-driven interface to register users, log in, add documents/audio files, retrieve them, and perform other management tasks.

## Important Considerations

*   **Password Security:** Choose strong, unique passwords for your user accounts.

## Code Explanation

*   **`encrypt(data, password)`:** This function encrypts the given data using AES-256 with a key derived from the provided password. It uses a random initialization vector (IV) for added security.
*   **`decrypt(encrypted_data, password)`:** This function decrypts the encrypted data using the same AES-256 key derived from the password.
*   **`register_user()`:** This function registers a new user, hashing their password using bcrypt before storing it in the database.
*   **`login_user()`:** This function authenticates a user by comparing the entered password with the bcrypt hash stored in the database.
*   **`validate_filename(filename)` and `validate_username(username)`:** These functions use regular expressions to validate filenames and usernames, preventing invalid or potentially malicious inputs.
*   **`sanitize_filename(filename)`:** This function sanitizes filenames to remove potentially harmful characters.
*   **`log_activity(activity, username)`:** This function logs user activity to an "access.log" file for auditing purposes.
